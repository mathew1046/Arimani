### Project Description
An avant-garde web application that leverages cutting-edge image analysis to discover names magically written on individual grains of rice from a photo you upload.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Do you ever gaze upon a bowl of rice and feel a profound sense of existential dread, wondering if your name has been meticulously inscribed onto a single grain, lost in the starchy abyss? This crippling anxiety affects millions, and until now, there was no solution.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've engineered a revolutionary platform to quell your fears. Simply upload a picture of rice, and our "powerful" algorithm will generate a definitive list of names found within. You can even search for your own name to see if you've finally achieved this pinnacle of anonymous recognition.

## Technical Details

- **Frameworks used**: None, this is pure, unadulterated vanilla JS.
